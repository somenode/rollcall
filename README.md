My significant other is faculty at a university. A couple weeks ago (while I was learning more Python), she said she wished there was a simpler way to take attendance. I agreed as I remembered my experiences as a TA. Why isn't there an easier way to track attendance? 

RollCall looks to help though, in its present form, needs many more features. Currently, there's no GUI though data is saved as a CSV file. 
Eventually, I'd like to add features that allows people to update student absences, calculate points at any time (rather than at the semester's end), and create a user-interface.
